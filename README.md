## 🚀 Overview
Sonic Similarity is an interactive 3D platform that maps audio relationships using vector analysis. By processing audio signals and calculating their mathematical similarity, the app projects audio samples into a 3D space, allowing users to explore "sonic neighborhoods" visually.

### ✨ Key Features
* **3D Similarity Map:** Explore thousands of audio samples in an interactive 3D cluster.
* **Dynamic "Popped" UI:** Sophisticated hover effects using `framer-motion` for detailed metadata display.
* **Real-time Vector Analysis:** Calculates audio proximity based on signal processing features.
* **Elegant Visuals:** High-performance rendering with `Three.js` and `React Three Fiber`.
